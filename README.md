# Short scripts of my own

- covid : a function which loads [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data) covid dataset and plots the main rates for a given country or the whole world
  - total deaths
  - new deaths
  - total cases
  - new cases
- imdb : a function which parses IMDb website and loads one of its charts, e.g. box office or most popular movies
- reviews : a script which parses [banki.ru](https://www.banki.ru/services/responses/) for a given bank, trains to classify reviews into complains/thanks and also into different products. The second classifier needs to be improved :(
- pec_and_ghg_connection : a simple visual EDA studying the connection between primary energy consumption and greenhouse gases emissions, which I wrote as a university homework, open data is again OWID team's courtesy
