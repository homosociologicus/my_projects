# Short scripts of my own

- covid : a function which loads [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data) covid dataset and plots the main rates for a given country or the whole world
  - total deaths
  - new deaths
  - total cases
  - new cases
- imdb : a function which parses IMDb website and loads one of its charts, e.g. box office or most popular movies
- reviews : a script which parses [banki.ru](https://www.banki.ru/services/responses/) for a given bank, trains to classify reviews into complains/thanks and also into different products. The second classifier needs to be improved.
- postgresql : [Chinook database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/tree/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources) for PostgreSQL and a little script of mine. I am just getting familiar with PostgreSQL:)
